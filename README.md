## Why Utility First CSS?

> **Naming** is one of the most difficult problems in CSS

Content-based **semantic** naming enables you to create artwork.

However, in a multi-person collaborative project, naming that you think is **semantic** can often be a nightmare to be around.

While **BEM** can standardize the way everyone on the team names things, however everyone still needs to name things based on their own understanding.

Among the popular CSS solutions, **Utility First CSS** solves this problem relatively effectively.

Because it already has a series of CSS class names for the UI that needs to be built, the core pain point of naming is naturally solved since there is no naming.

### Utility First CSS

```html
<style>
/* The following CSS code has already been created in the initial phase, and only needs to be used in the development phase */
.fs16{ font-size: 16px; }
.lh24{ line-height: 24px; }
.fw400{ font-weight: 400; }
.fw900{ font-weight: 900; }
</style>

<h1 class="fs16 lh24 fw900">Hello world</h1>
<p class="fs16 lh24 fw400">Utility First CSS</p>
```

### Semantic CSS

```html
<style>
.h1{
  font-size:16px;
  line-height:24px;
  font-weight:900;
}
.paragraph{
  font-size:16px;
  line-height:24px;
  font-weight:400;
}
</style>
<h1 class="h1">Hello world</h1>
<p class="paragraph">Semantic CSS</p>
```

Ideally, we don't need to **create** any CSS Classes, we just need to **combine** (piece together multiple Classes) to complete the UI.

Of course, **Utility First CSS** solves the core pain point of naming.

It also significantly improves CSS writing **efficiency** and minimizes CSS code **bulk**.

## Why Not Tailwind CSS?

> Tailwind CSS is very good, but not always suitable.

There are many CSS solutions based on **Utility First CSS**, the most famous one is [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which is also the ! [github](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.svg?style=social) has the highest number of libraries.

Tailwind CSS class library provides **rich** and **comprehensive** CSS class names, so that we can quickly implement UI by focusing on HTML.

However, because it is **big and comprehensive**, it is relatively expensive to **get started** and **remember**, and there is always a feeling of **killing a chicken with a bull**.

SACSS is focused on showing you how to create **Utility First CSS** ([naming convention](. /guides.name)).

For example, if you want to achieve the text **horizontally centered** `text-align:center;` effect.

When using Tailwind CSS, we need to search through the entire library of hundreds of Class Name classes to find the Class Name (`.text-center`) that corresponds to **horizontally centered**.

When using SACSS, your path is this: you first know that the code for **horizontally centered** is `.text-align:center;` and then you get `.tac` based on the formula for naming rules that only take **initial letters**.

That means you see the Style property and you know what the corresponding Class Name is, no need to remember it at all, and this pattern will greatly increase the **development experience**.

```html
<!-- Tailwind CSS -->
<style>
.text-center{ text-align: center; }
</style>
<h1 class="text-center">hello world</h1>

<!-- SACSS -->
<style>
.tac{ text-align: center; }
</style>
<h1 class="tac">hello world</h1>
```

We also created the [Figma plugin] for this set of naming rules (. /intro.design), with this plugin you even you only need to **copy** and **paste** the project code from the design tool.
