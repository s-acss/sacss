# About

SACSS is attempt to help you create **Utility First CSS** class library for your project **faster** and **easier**.

## Why Utility First CSS?

> **Naming** is one of the most difficult problems in CSS

Content-based **semantic** naming enables you to create artwork.

However in a multi-person collaborative project, naming that you think is **semantic** can often be a nightmare to be around.

**BEM** can normalize the way everyone on the team names things, yet everyone still needs to name things based on their own understanding.

Among the popular CSS solutions, **Utility First CSS** solves this problem relatively effectively.

This is because it already has a set of CSS class names for the UI that needs to be built.

Ideally, we don't need to **create** any CSS Classes, we just need to **combine** (piece together multiple Classes) to complete the UI.

Since there is no naming, this naturally solves the core pain point of naming.

```css
/* semantic class */
.h1{ font-size:16px; line-height:24px; font-weight:900; }

/* Utility First CSS */
.fs12{ font-size: 16px; }
.lh24{ line-height: 24px; }
.fw900{ font-weight: 900; }
```

```html
<h1 class="h1">hello world</h1>
<h1 class="fs16 lh24 fw900">hello world</h1>
```

Of course **Utility First CSS** addresses the core pain point of naming. It also significantly improves CSS writing **efficiency** and maximizes control of CSS code **bulk**.

> The more single-functional the class, the higher the reuse rate

## Why not Tailwind CSS?

> Tailwind CSS is great, but it doesn't always fit.

There are many CSS solutions based on **Utility First CSS**, the most famous one is  [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)  which has the highest  ![github](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.svg?style=social) count of any CSS solution.

The Tailwind CSS library provides a very comprehensive set of CSS class names to allow us to quickly implement the UI by focusing on the HTML.

However, because it is **big and comprehensive**, it is relatively expensive to **get started** and **remember**, and there is always a feeling of **killing a chicken with a bull**.

## Try SACSS

> SACSS: Static Atomic CSS

SACSS is all about customizing your project's **Utility First CSS** code base based on your fellow designers' **design language**.

Unlike Tailwind CSS, with SACSS you don't have to remember hundreds of CSS class names, instead there are just a few **Naming Rules**.

For example, if you want to achieve the effect `text-align:center;` of centered text alignment.

In Tailwind CSS we have to remember that the corresponding Class Name is `.text-center`.

In SACSS `Naming Rule Formula ('text-align:center;') => .tac`, and the base rule for this formula is to take only **initial letters**.

That is to say, you see the style attribute, you know what the corresponding class name is, no need to remember at all, this pattern will greatly increase the **development experience**.

And based on this **Naming Rules Formula**, the team is free to maintain your own **Utility First CSS** class library for your project.

> The SACSS core is in **Naming Rules**, so it is completely customizable to your own project.

## Design Tools

[Figma token to code](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/759651077059504375/Token--%3E-Code) This plugin will automatically help you get the SACSS code directly from the Figma design.

That is, you may not even need to remember this naming formula to further enhance the development experience.

## Simple example

import Demo from "@site/src/components/Demo";

<Demo/>

## Complex example

import AvatarTitleDesc from "@site/src/demo/AvatarTitleDesc";

<AvatarTitleDesc/>

```html live
<div className="bc_fff tac pt24 pb24 pl24 pr24 br8">
  <img className="w128 h128 br100% db mla mra mb24" src="/img/avatar.jpg"
       alt="avatar" width="128" height="128"/>
  <div className="mb16 fs18 fw700 lh28 c_m">
    <p className="mb8">Tailwind CSS is the only framework that I've seen scale on large teams.</p>
    <p>It’s easy to customize, adapts to any design, and the build size is tiny.</p>
  </div>
  <div className="fs16 lh24">
    <em className="db c_info fsn fw500">Sarah Dayan</em>
    <strong className="db c_s fw500">Staff Engineer, Algolia</strong>
  </div>
</div>
```
