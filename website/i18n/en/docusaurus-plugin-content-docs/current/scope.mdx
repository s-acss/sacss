# Namespaces

**Theoretically** the global introduction of the file `sacss/index.css`, in which all class names will become global CSS keywords, can easily cause CSS **naming pollution**.

Here we provide the LESS and SASS `WidthPrefix` Mixin to add a unified prefix to the entire core code as a **namespace** to reduce the scope of **pollution**.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs
  defaultValue="less"
  values={[
    { label: 'LESS', value: 'less', },
    { label: 'SASS', value: 'sass', }
  ]
}
>
<TabItem value="less">

```less
@import 'sacss/less/WidthPrefix';

@prefix: '_';  // Replace this with the prefix you want to add

#WidthPrefix(@prefix);

/** The build will output the following code */
// ._db{display:block}
// ._df{display:flex}
// ._fw400{font-weight:400}
// ...
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="sass">

```scss
@import 'sacss/sass/WidthPrefix';

$prefix: '_'; // Replace this with the prefix you want to add

@include WidthPrefix($prefix);

/** The build will output the following code */
// ._db{display:block}
// ._df{display:flex}
// ._fw400{font-weight:400}
// ...
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

> CSS does not have Mixin function, please download the CSS file to add it manually.

This way all our core classes will be prefixed with `_`.

## Not recommended

Although we provide the ability to add **prefixes** to the core code.

However, in practice, we don't really recommend doing this.

Or we recommend that prefixes should be as short as possible, and `_` is the only prefix we **recommend** to use.

Because the core code of SACSS is used very frequently, writing a prefix before each class would increase the amount of code and make it unusually verbose.

Moreover, the problem of **naming pollution**, in our actual multiple projects and years of experience, the probability of occurrence is very small, and even if it happens, it is easy to avoid.
